Cloud providers sometimes are undependable, and also highly centralized. Imagine if every pool is running on AWS, what happens 
when AWS is down (it happened before,) or they decided not to allow Cardano Staking Pool to run on AWS.

We believe, if Cardano wants to achieve high level of decentralization, we need to build our own infrastructure.

We built the staking pool with a Cisco Server, which has 2 x Intel Xeon Processors and 64GB memory. The server is connected 
to the Internet with a dedicated 1Gbps connection through a Cisco Security Appliance.

We provisioned the staking pool with much higher specifications than minimum requirements with 4 x vCPUs with 16GB memory.
