I came across this awesome community on Telegram, which helps small stake pools to take off.

The group name is <a href='https://t.me/StakePoolBootstrapChannel'>Stake Pool Bootstrap Channel</a>

The idea is to amalgamate the stakes from volunteers and pool operators, and stake to the small pools for 2 epochs to 
bootstrap the small stake pools.

Here I do see the power of community. Join us and we can help each other and the whole ecosystem.
